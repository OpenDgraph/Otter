# Otter ðŸ¦¦

> Under construction ðŸš§

Otter is a lightweight proxy designed to intelligently balance traffic to [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io). It currently supports round-robin or purpose-based balancing between groups of endpoints.

### Features

-  Query
-  Mutation
-  Upsert
-  WebSocket JSON API (`ws://localhost:8081/ws`)

---

### Example WebSocket Payload

```json
{
  "type": "upsert",
  "query": "query { u as var(func: eq(email, \"test@example.com\")) }",
  "mutation": "uid(u) <name> \"Test\" .",
  "cond": "@if(eq(len(u), 1))",
  "commitNow": true
}
```

---

### Run Locally

```bash
export CONFIG_FILE=./manifest/config.yaml
go run cmd/proxy/main.go
```

Set your balancer strategy inside `config.yaml`:

```yaml
balancer_type: purposeful # or round-robin
```
